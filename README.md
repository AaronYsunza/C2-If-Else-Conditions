## If/Elif/Else Conditional Statements
Used for decision-making operations with conditions 

Conditional statements always start with an
`if` header
`elif` optional, but we can have as many as we want
`else` optional, but only 1 for every `if`

### Condition:
An expression that evaluates to produce a resulrt which is a Boolean value (AKA. Boolean expression)\

## Indentation:
Python relies on indentation ot define scope in the code

### Formula:
if (Condition):
> Body Statement:

elif (Condition):
> Body Statement:

else:
> Body Statement

*Ex.*
```
a = 2
if(a == 0): # False
  print ("hi)
else:
  print("bye")
```
> "bye"

## Nested Conditional Statements

A conditional statement inside another conditional statement

### Indentation

The header/caluse of a nested conditional statement must be indented from an outer header

### Formula:

```
if(Condition):
  if(Condition): <-- Starting a nested statement
    Body Statement
  elif(Condition):
    Body Statement
  else:
    Body Statement <-- End of nested statement
elif(Condition):
  Body Statement
else:
  Body Statement
```

*Ex.*

```
x = 10
y = 10
if (x < y):
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  if(x > y):
    print("x is greater than y"):
  else:
    print("x and y must be equal"):
```
  > x and y must be equal
